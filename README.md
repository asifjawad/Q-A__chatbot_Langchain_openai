# Q&A Chatbot through OpenAI
-------------------------------

## Introduction
This repository contains code for a Q&A chatbot powered by OpenAI's language model. The chatbot allows users to input questions and receive responses based on the provided text input.

## Installation
To run this code, you need to install the necessary dependencies. You can do this using pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To use the Q&A chatbot, follow these steps:

- Ensure you have set up the necessary environment variables in a `.env` file.
Run the Streamlit application using the following command:
```
streamlit run app.py
```

- Once the application is running, input your question in the provided text input field.
- Click on the `Ask the question` button to receive a response from the chatbot.

# How It Works

The Q&A chatbot works by utilizing OpenAI's language model to process user input and generate responses. Here's how it operates:

- Importing Dependencies: The necessary libraries and modules are imported to enable functionality.

- Loading OpenAI Model and Getting Responses: A function is defined to load the OpenAI model and retrieve responses - based on user questions.

- Initializing Streamlit Application: The Streamlit application is initialized, and its page configuration is set.

- User Interaction: Users input their questions in a text input field, and a button allows them to submit the question.
- Displaying Responses: Once the user submits the question, the chatbot generates a response based on the input and displays it.

# Conclusion

This project provides a simple yet effective Q&A chatbot powered by OpenAI's language model. Users can interact with the chatbot to receive responses to their questions. Further enhancements and customizations can be made based on specific requirements and use cases.
